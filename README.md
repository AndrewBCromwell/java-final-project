# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction
During the introduction, I learned how to use the Git Bash command line to get from file to file and create new files. I also made a GitHub repository to share the things that that I have made. I can use Git Bash to update this repository with any changes that I made in Visual Studio Code.

I also learned how to use Markdown, which is like a simplified form of HTML, to make words *italic,* **bold,** and ~~struck through.~~ In addition, I can make

* lists
* tables
* `code blocks`
* and Emojis :smile:
